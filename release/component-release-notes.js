// @semantic-release/release-notes-generator, with the same options; this hands those options,
// and a context holding only the module's own commits, to the real generator.

// Resolved from process.cwd() rather than from this file: semantic-release runs in the
// module's directory, and the dependency is installed in the module's own node_modules, not
// beside this file.
